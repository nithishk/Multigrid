### Multigrid method 


This simple code solves the Poisson equation for open boundary problems 

In particular can it solve problems with periodic, Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions individually selected on each boundary.
Method

We employ an adaptive/customizable multi grid method where every level can be controlled arbitrarily by the user.
Usage


The precision can be controlled to arbitrary value. However, it is not stringently following conventional multi-grid methods as we simply want a reasonable guess for the Poisson solution.
